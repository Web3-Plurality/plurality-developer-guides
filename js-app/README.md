# To run locally

We need to run this html file on a well defined domain because the widget does domain verification. 

Here are the steps to run this on local sever:

1. Install the http-server (if needed)
```
npm install -g http-server

```
2. Change the directory to the path of html file and start the server on desired port which is registered in developer dashboard (e.g. http://localhost:3001)
```
cd /path/to/your/project

http-server -p 3001 

```
