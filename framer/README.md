# To create a code component  
In your Framer application, you can create a code component using plurality's widget as a react dependency. This code component can later be used in your application/website at Framer.  

Here is a basic demo of a simplified code component that integrates with Plurality's smart profile wallet.

Please note that you need to register your domains and get clientId from https://developer.plurality.network and update the example code above.
